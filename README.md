# Build and runtime dependencies

Clone repo and install build dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aweeraman/odyssey.git
$ sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ make m4 bison flex bzip2 xz-utils curl zlib1g-dev gnat python
```

Build GCC cross compiler and openboot:

```
$ cd odyssey
$ make deps
```

Install additional dependencies required for building and running odyssey
in qemu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install grub-common mtools qemu-system-gui qemu-system-x86 ovmf exuberant-ctags u-boot-tools
```

Optionally, if you wish to use clang, you can install it and configure
it in the build config as follows:

```
$ sudo apt-get install clang
```

Set the following variables in config/build.cfg to use clang:

```
CC        := clang
```

nasm is built as part of the cross compiler dependencies and can be
used in place GNU as for building the assembly programs by setting
the following in in config/build.cfg. The GNU assembler will be used
by default.

```
AS        := ../coreboot/util/crossgcc/xgcc/bin/nasm
```

# Running in qemu

To build and run in qemu:

```
$ make boot     # defaults to x86
```

or, to build the ARM version:

```
$ make ARCH=arm clean boot
```

To build and run in qemu with OVMS/EFI:

```
$ make boot-efi
```

# Running in qemu on ARM/U-Boot

Install a tftp-server to serve the OS image:

```
$ sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa
$ sudo systemctl start tftpd-hpa
```

Build the OS image and copy over to the tftp server location:

```
$ make ARCH=arm
$ make ARCH=arm img
$ sudo cp odyssey.img /srv/tftp
$ make ARCH=arm boot-uboot
```

At the U-Boot prompt, enter the following:

```
setenv ipaddr 10.x.x.x
setenv serverip 192.x.x.x
tftp 80000000 odyssey.img
iminfo 80000000
bootm 80000000
```

# Configuration

List capabilities to be included in the kernel in config/kernel.cfg.
Currently available options are:

```
# Prefix with a leading hash (#) to disable a feature

CONFIG_VERSION_MAJOR=0
CONFIG_VERSION_MINOR=1

# Drivers / hardware support
CONFIG_SERIAL
CONFIG_KEYBOARD

# Framebuffer console
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_RGB
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_WIDTH=1024
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_HEIGHT=768
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_BPP=32

# FirstFit memory manager
CONFIG_MM_FF

# Run tests during boot
CONFIG_TEST
```

# Debugging

~/.gdbinit:

```
set print pretty on
set architecture i386:x86-64
target remote :1234
```

Enable following in config/build.cfg:

```
DEBUG     := yes
```

Run 'make boot' and in a different shell start gdb and set a breakpoint to
step through the code:

```
$ gdb src/kernel
Reading symbols from src/kernel...
(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
(gdb) break kernel_main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1007c0: file kernel.c, line 26.
(gdb) c
```
